## Quiz

The course has one 75-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.

Anything in readings, labs and homework from weeks 1 through 7 can be on the quiz. So best to review the readings!
