# Week 5 Lab: Sounds good!

[35 pts]

## Starting files to download

**Starter file for this problem:**

[Download pythonSounds.zip from this link.](pythonSounds.zip)

Be sure to unzip that folder somewhere. It has several files that need to be in the same folder:

* hw5pr1.py   (the file to edit and run!)
* swfaith.wav
* swnotry.wav
* spam.wav
* csaudio.py
* play   (A small MacOS application for playing sounds...) 

## You need to work from within this folder!

* To do this, be sure to `cd` into the `pythonSounds` folder.
* For example, you can move the _whole_ `pythonSounds` folder to your desktop
* Then `cd Desktop` and `cd pythonSounds`
* From there, you can run the usual `python -i hw5pr1.py`

**If you move the `hw5pr1.py` file without the other files, things won't work!**

## Warm-up: helper functions using list comprehensions

To begin, remind yourself how _list comprehensions_ work. Look over the `three_ize` function near the top of the file:

    def three_ize(L):
        """ three_ize is the motto of the green CS 5 alien.
        It's also a function that takes in a list and
        returns a list of elements each three times as large.
        """
        # this is an example of a list comprehension
        LC = [ 3*x for x in L]
        return LC

This function _maps_ the expression `3*x` over the values `x` in the list `L`.

Try it out with

**Example(s):**

    >>> three_ize([13, 14, 15])
    [39, 42, 45]

List comprehensions are a versatile syntax for mapping a function (or expression) across all elements of a list.

##Function to write #1: `scale`

With the above function as your model, write a function `scale` with the following signature:

    def scale(L, scale_factor):

where `scale` returns a list similar to `L`, except that each element has been multiplied by `scale_factor`.

**Example(s):**

    >>> scale([70, 80, 420], 0.1)
    [7.0, 8.0, 42.0]

_Use a list comprehension here._


##Going further: index-based list comprehensions

Next, make sure this function is in your `hw5pr1.py` file. Look it over:

    def three_ize_by_index(L):
        """ three_ize_by_index has the same I/O behavior as three_ize
        but it uses the INDEX of each element, instead of
        using the elements themselves -- this is much more flexible!
        """
        # we get the length of L first, in order to use it in range:
        N = len(L)
        LC = [ 3*L[i] for i in range(N)]
        return LC

This function does exactly the same thing as `three_ize`—it simply uses the index of each element to do so. That is, now the **location** of each element, named `i`, is changing

This index-based use of list comprehensions is even more flexible than the element-based style, as the next couple of questions will show.

##Another index-based list comprehension

Next, try this function in your `hw5pr1.py` file:

    def wrap1(L):
        """ What does this do -- and why?! """
        N = len(L)
        LC = [ L[i-1] for i in range(N)]
        return LC

Try `wrap1(range(5))` and `wrap1([41, 42, 43])`.

Try out this function and write a one-sentence summary of what it's doing…and how.

Hint: `L` is the old (input) list. `LC` is the new (output) list.


##Function to write #2: wrapn

With the above function as your model, write a function wrapn with the following signature:

    def wrapn(L, n):

so that `wrapn` returns a list similar to `L`, except that each element has been moved to the right `n` spots. In addition, the final `n` elements of the original list `L` should be _wrapped around_ to the initial elements of the result.

**Example(s):**

    >>> wrapn([6, 7, 8, 9], 1)
    [9, 6, 7, 8]

    >>> wrapn([6, 7, 8, 9], 3)
    [7, 8, 9, 6]

The value of `n` does not have to work past one less than the length of `L`

##Function to write #3: `add_2`

With the above **index-based** functions as a guide, write a function `add_2` with the following signature:

    def add_2(L, M):

such that `add_2` takes in two lists and returns a single list that is an element-by-element sum of the two arguments. If the arguments are different lengths, your `add_2` should return a list that is as long as the _shorter_ of the two. Just drop the extra elements from the longer list.

Use the _index-based_ approach for this `add_2` function. You might use `three_ize_by_index` as a starting point…. Also, consider how this `LC` might help:

    LC = [ L[i]+M[i] for ... ]

Here are two examples of `add_2` in action:

    >>> add_2([10, 11, 12], [20, 25, 30])
    [30, 36, 42]

    >>> add_2([10, 11], [20, 25, 30])
    [30, 36]


##Function to write #4: `add_scale_2`

Next, write a function `add_scale_2` with the following signature:

    def add_scale_2(L, M, L_scale, M_scale):

such that `add_scale_2` takes in two lists `L` and `M` and two floating-point numbers `L_scale` and `M_scale`. These stand for _scale for L_ and _scale for M_, respectively.

Then, `add_scale_2` should return a single list that is an element-by-element sum of the two inputs, _each scaled by its respective floating-point value_. If the inputs are different lengths, your `add_scale_2` should return a list that is as long as the _shorter_ of the two. Again, just drop any extra elements.

**Example(s):**

    >>> add_scale_2([10, 20, 30], [7, 8, 9], 0.1, 10)
    [71.0, 82.0, 93.0]

    >>> add_scale_2([10, 20, 30], [7, 8], 0.1, 10)
    [71.0, 82.0]

This will not be too different from the previous example!

##A helper function: `randomize`

Next, take a look at this function in your `hw5pr1.py` file:

    def randomize(x, chance_of_replacing):
        """ randomize takes in an original value, x
        and a fraction named chance_of_replacing.

        With the "chance_of_replacing" chance, it
        should return a random float from -32767 to 32767.

        Otherwise, it should return x (not replacing it).
        """
        r = random.uniform(0,1)
        if r < chance_of_replacing:
            return random.uniform(-32768,32767)
        else:
            return x

(Note that atop the program, we included the statement `import random` to ensure that the `random.uniform` function is available!)

Read over the docstring and try it out—it's random, but here is a set of five real runs:

    >>> randomize(42, .5)
    42
    >>> randomize(42, .5)
    42
    >>> randomize(42, .5)
    29209.30669767395
    >>> randomize(42, .5)
    42
    >>> randomize(42, .5)
    17751.221299744262


##Function to write #5: replace_some

Next, write a function `replace_some` with the following signature:

    def replace_some(L, chance_of_replacing):

such that `replace_some` takes in a list `L` and a floating-point value `chance_of_replacing`.

Then, `replace_some` should independently replace—or not replace—each element in `L`, using the helper function `randomize`. Since this function is random, the runs below won't be replicated on your system, but try yours out to make sure it's working in a similar fashion.

**Hint:** use `randomize` in a list comprehension: that's it! Consider how to complete this thought (and don't forget to return `LC`):

    LC = [ randomize(... , ...) for x in L]

**Example(s):**

    # replace about half  (hopefully 42 remains!)
    >>> replace_some(range(40,50), .5)
    [40, 41, 42, -17461.09350529409, 44, -13989.513742241645, 46, -26247.774200304026, 48, 49]
    
    # replace about a tenth  (but it's random: here 2 of them get replaced)
    >>> replace_some(range(20,30), .1)
    [20, 21, 16774.26240973895, 23, 24, 25, -18184.919872079583, 27, 28, 29]


In addition to providing practice with data and functions, the above examples will be helpful in creating functions that handle audio data in various ways... .


#Sound coding...

First things first: try out this function, which should already be in your `hw5pr1.py` file.

You can run it with `test():`

    def test():
        """ a test function that plays swfaith.wav
        You'll need swfaith.wav in the same folder.
        """
        play('swfaith.wav')

For this to work, your Python will need to support sound (every version we've tested does). Also, you'll need the `swfaith.wav` file in the folder in which `hw5pr1.py` is located. As long as you're in the original folder, all of this should be the case. If not, go grab all of those files that came with `hw5pr1.py` and copy them over to whichever folder you're working in.

Before we go on, you'll need a bit of background information on audio data. Then you'll have a chance to write a number of audio-processing functions.


#Background on representing audio information

What is inside an audio file?

Depending on the format, the actual audio data might be encoded in many different ways. One of the most basic is known as pulse code modulation (PCM), in which the sound waves are sampled every so often and given values in the range -128 to 127 (if 1 byte per sound sample is used) or -32768 to 32767 (if there are 2 bytes for each sample). [Wikipedia explains it here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation)

The **.wav** file format encodes audio in basically this way, and the cross-platform program [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/) is an excellent tool for visualizing the individual PCM samples of an audio file. You don't need Audacity for this problem, but it runs on Windows and Macs and is fun to play around with if you'd like to. Audacity can also convert to _.wav_ from _.mp3_ and many other formats.

##Getting started with sound

We present two examples to start acquiring and manipulating sound data. Try these:

###Sound example #1: `changeSpeed`

This function should already be in your file, but if not, it's here for easy copy-and-paste:

**Note:** if you run this and have problems with `wave.big_endian`? See below for a fix...

    # The example changeSpeed function
    def changeSpeed(filename, newsr):
        """ changeSpeed allows the user to change an audio file's speed
        input: filename, the name of the original file
               newsr, the *new* sampling rate in samples per second
        output: no return value; creates and plays the file 'out.wav'
        """
        samps, sr = readwav(filename)

        print "The first 10 sound-pressure samples are\n", samps[:10]
        print "The original number of samples per second is", sr

        newsamps = samps                        # no change to the sound
        writewav(newsamps, newsr, "out.wav")  # write data to out.wav
        print "\nPlaying new sound..."
        play('out.wav')   # play the new file, 'out.wav'

Read over this example and try it out on the three sound files provided:

    >>> changeSpeed("swfaith.wav", 44100) # fast Vader
    ... lots of printing ...

    >>> changeSpeed("spam.wav", 11025)  # slow Monty Python
    ... lots of printing ...

    >>> changeSpeed("swnotry.wav", 22050) # regular-speed Yoda
    ... lots of printing ...

**Problems with** `wave.big_endian`? Newer Python versions need these lines at the top of `hw5pr1.py`:

    import wave
    wave.big_endian = 0

Add those two lines and, we hope, things will work more smoothly!

**Before continuing**, it's good to review some points about the code and how it works:

1. The sound data is returned by the call to `readwav` in two **seperate** parts using the call  
```
samps, sr = readwav(filename)
```
<br/>
Python is nice in that you can return any number of values from a function. Here, `readwav` is returning two values; `samps` and `sr`.
2. After that call, the variable `samps` should have a large list of raw pressure samples (floats). **Don't print this list**—it can be too big and can slow down or choke the Python shell!
3. Also, after that call, the variable `sr` is an integer that represents the _sampling rate_, i.e., the number of samples that should be played per second for normal-speed playback.
4. Some printing happens, so that you can see a little bit of the data. Again, it's a _bad_ idea to print all of the sound samples—some versions of Python can choke or freeze when printing so much data!
5. We already have the new sampling rate—that was the `newsr` argument. For consistency, we use the variable `newsamps` to label the old sound data samples. In this case they're not changing at all, but in later programs they will.
6. The code then writes `newsamps` and `newsr` out to a file, named `out.wav`, which will appear in the folder you're working in (replacing the old one if there was already an `out.wav`).
7. To finish, the function plays that new file, which may be a different speed than the original depending on the value of `newsr`. 

The next example will illustrate how to create a new sound by changing the samples themselves.

###Sound example #2: flipflop

This function should already be in your file, but if not, it's also here for easy reference and copy-and-paste:

    def flipflop(filename):
        """ flipflop swaps the halves of an audio file
        input: filename, the name of the original file
        output: no return value, but this creates the
                sound file 'out.wav' and plays it
        """
        print "Playing the original sound..."
        play(filename)

        print "Reading in the sound data..."
        samps, sr = readwav(filename)

        print "Computing new sound..."
        # this gets the midpoint and calls it x
        x = len(samps)/2
        newsamps = samps[x:] + samps[:x] # flip flop
        newsr = sr                       # no change to the sr

        writewav(newsamps, newsr, "out.wav")
        print "Playing new sound..."
        play('out.wav')

Take a look at the middle part of this code, where the new sound samples are created from the old ones. In this case, the `newsamps` are a _flipflopped_ version of the old `samps`.

As a result, the sound's second half is placed before its first half.

In building your audio-processing functions, use `flipflop` as a starting point.


##Sound function to write #1: `reverse`

Next, write a sound-handling function `reverse` with the following signature:

    def reverse(filename):

such that reverse takes in a `filename` as did `flipflop`.

Like `flipflop`, the sampling rate should not change, but the function should create a _reversed_ set of sound samples and then handle them in the same way as the two examples above. That is, you'll want to write them to the file `out.wav` and then play that file.

**Remember** to reverse the list `L`, you can write `L[::-1]` in Python! With this you *slice* the whole list (from *start* to *end*) using steps of *-1*, i.e. reverse the list.

Copy-and-paste `flipflop` to use it as a starting point.

**Example(s):**
    
    # redaV htraD sounds eerier but less intimidating 
    >>> reverse('swfaith.wav')
    ... lots of printing ...

Note that this `reverse` function won't need to use one any the helper functions you wrote above, but the next few will!

##Sound function to write #2: `volume`

Now, write a sound-handling function volume with the following signature:

    def volume(filename, scale_factor):

such that `volume` takes in a `filename` as usual and a floating-point value `scale_factor`. Then, `volume` should handle the sound in the usual way, with the output file and played sound being scaled in amplitude (volume) by the scaling factor `scale_factor`. That is, each sample should be multiplied by `scale_factor`.

Here, you could use the helper function `scale` you wrote at the beginning of the lab... .

**Example(s):**
    
    # A calmer Darth...
    >>> volume('swfaith.wav', .1)  
    ... lots of printing ...

    # A caffeinated Darth!
    >>> volume('swfaith.wav', 10.0)  
    ... lots of printing ...

You'll notice that your hearing adjusts remarkably well to this function's changes in absolute volume, making the perceived effect considerably less than you might expect.

You will also find that if you _increase_ the volume too much, the sound becomes distorted, just as when an amplifier is turned up to 11.

##Sound function to write #3: `static`

Now, write a sound-handling function `static` with the following signature:

    def static(filename, probability_of_static):

such that `static` takes in a `filename` as usual and a floating-point value `probability_of_static`, which you can assume will be between 0 and 1.

Then, `static` should handle the sound in the usual way, with the output samples being replaced with the probability of `probability_of_static`. When they're replaced, the samples should simply be random values, uniformly chosen in the valid range from -32768 to 32767.

Here, you should use the helper function `replace_some` that you wrote at the beginning of the lab. You won't need `randomize`, because `replace_some` already uses it!

**Example(s):**

    # Vader, driving into a tunnel
    >>> static('swfaith.wav', .05)  
    ... lots of printing ...

    # Vader on dial-up from a galaxy far, far away
    >>> static('swfaith.wav', .25)  
    ... lots of printing ...

You might see how high you can increase the percentage of static until the original is no longer discernable. People adapt less well to this than to volume changes.

##Sound function to write #4: `overlay`

Now, write a sound-handling function `overlay` with the following signature:

    def overlay(filename1, filename2): 

such that `overlay` takes in _two_ `filenames` as usual, and it creates a new sound that overlays the two. The result should be as long as the shorter of the two. (Drop any extra samples, just as in `add_scale_2`.)

Use your `add_scale_2` helper function to assist with this! That way, you can adjust the relative loudness of the two input files. You are welcome, but certainly not required, to add more input arguments to your `overlay` function so that you can change the relative volumes on the fly (or crop the sounds on the fly, which is a bit more ambitious).

**Remember** that `add_scale_2(samps1, samps2, 0.5, 0.5)` **must** take lists (`samps`) as input -- not filenames, which are simply strings! The `samps` are lists of the raw sound data.

**Example(s):**

    # Vader vs. Yoda
    >>> overlay('swfaith.wav', 'swnotry.wav')  
    ... lots of printing ...

The next function overlays a file with a shifted version of itself.

##Sound function to write #5: `echo`

This one is more of a challenge... .

Try writing a sound-handling function `echo` with the following signature:

    def echo(filename, time_delay):

such that `echo` takes in a `filename` as usual and a floating-point value `time_delay`, which represents a number of seconds.

Then, `echo` should handle the sound in the usual way, with the original sound being overlaid by a copy of itself shifted forward in time by `time_delay`.

Notice that you can use the sampling rate to convert between the number of samples and time in seconds!

* For example, if `time_delay` is `0.1` and the sampling rate is `22050`, then the number of samples to wait is `2205`
* Similarly, if `time_delay` is `0.25` and the sampling rate is `44100`, then the number of samples to wait is `11025` 

**Hint on how to wait samples:** the easiest way to add _blank space_ or _blank sound_ in front of `samps` is to concatenate zeros to the front of the list `samps`. For example,

    samps2 = [0]*42 + samps

would _wait_ 42 samples (include 42 blank-sound samples) at the start of the sound data `samps`. You'll probably want a value other than 42!

So, your task here is to figure out what integer you need _instead of 42_... . Also, do make sure it's an integer - you can use `int()` for that purpose.

**Example(s):**

    # How many zeros are there to add!?
    >>> echo('swfaith.wav', .1)  
    ... lots of printing ...


##Sound Example #3: generating pure tones

The final examples of provided functions generate a pure sine-wave tone. Here is the code, though it should also be in the file:

    # Helper function for generating pure tones
    def gen_pure_tone(freq, seconds):
        """ pure_tone returns the y-values of a cosine wave
        whose frequency is freq Hertz.
        It returns nsamples values, taken once every 1/44100 of a second;
        thus, the sampling rate is 44100 Hertz.
        0.5 second (22050 samples) is probably enough.
        """
        sr = 44100
        
        # how many data samples to create, rounded down
        nsamples = int(seconds*sr)
        
        # our frequency-scaling coefficient, converts from samples to Hz
        f = 2*math.pi/sr 
        
        # our amplitude-scaling coefficient, a
        a = 32767.0
        
        # the sound's air-pressure samples
        samps = [ a*math.sin(f*n*freq) for n in range(nsamples)]
        
        # return both...
        return samps, sr


    def pure_tone(freq, time_in_seconds):
        """ plays a pure tone of frequence freq for time_in_seconds seconds """
        print "Generating tone..."
        samps, sr = gen_pure_tone(freq, time_in_seconds)
        
        print "Writing out the sound data..."
        writewav(samps, sr, "out.wav")
        
        print "Playing new sound..."
        play('out.wav')

Look over this code and try it out to get a feel for what it does, though the math of the sine wave is not crucial.

Rather, the important details are that the function `pure_tone` takes a desired frequency `freq` and the span `time_in_seconds`. The mathematical details are then delegated to `gen_pure_tone`.

**Example(s):**

    # 0.5 seconds of the concert-tuning A
    >>> pure_tone(440, 0.5)  
    ... lots of printing ...

You can look up frequencies for other notes at [at this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies), among many others.

##Sound function to write #6: chord

The final lab problem is to build on the above example to write a chord-creation function named `chord` with the following signature:

    def chord(f1, f2, f3, time_in_seconds):

such that `chord` takes in three floating-point frequencies `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, along with a floating-point `time_in_seconds`. Then, `chord` should create and play a three-note chord from those frequencies.

**Example(s):**

    # A minor chord
    >>> chord(440.000, 523.251, 659.255, 1.0)   
    ... lots of printing ...

If your chord sounds static-y, you may have used `add_scale_2` with **too** large a set of coefficients for the combined sounds!

* You'll want to keep the overall amplitude at `1.0`
* Since the original amplitude is `1.0`, you'll need to use fractional scale values to make sure the overall amplitude of the summed waves stays at `1.0` or less
* If the wave exceeds `1.0` in amplitude, it will be _clipped_ by the speakers, which then sounds like loud static overlaying the sound... .
