# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is a _cellular automaton_ created by the mathematican John
Conway in 1970. It is not a game in the traditional sense, as you can only 
input an initial configuration and then the rules of the game will dictate what 
happens next. The game consists of board of `cells`, each either `alive` or
`dead` and the rules to evolve the board to the next state. You can keep
applying those rules and some very interesting patterns might result from 
a simple starting board. It is called the Game of Life because it can be used 
to study how complex things can emerge from simple rules, just as we might 
consider the case to be with actual life.

### The rules

Each cell is influenced by its 8 neighbour cells (the 3x3 square surrounding 
the cell). There are just 4 rules:

1. Each cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (starvation)
2. Each cell with 2 live neighbours remains unchanged (survival)
3. Each cell with 3 live neighbours becomes alive (birth)
2. Each cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overcrowding)

### Some examples

Here are some very simple patterns that the Game of Life can produce. (A black 
cell is alive and a white cell is dead)

The block, which does not change, because each of the four cells is surrounded 
by 3 live cells.

The blinker, which alternates between 2 patterns. Try and see if you can figure 
out why!

The glider, which moves across the board as it repeats. Here it already becomes 
hard to see why the pattern would move that way, and it only uses 5 alive
cells.

## This week's assignment

This week we will implement the Game of Life in Python. For the graphics we 
will use Pygame, which you will hopefully already have installed (if not, see 
[the preparations](http://progik.mprog.nl/preparation/week-7)). All of the 
graphics code has already been written, all you need to do is implement the 
game functions.

Download the starter file for this week [here](conway.py).

### A little primer on nested for loops

For this assignment we will use quite a few nested `for` loops (a for loop 
inside a for loop), so here is a reminder on how they work. A regular for loop 
just repeats the code in the loop a number of times, like:

    >>>for i in range(4):
    ...    print i
    0
    1
    2
    3

Now, if we put another for loop in the place of that print statement, the entire
loop will be repeated `4` times. So if we added `for j in range(3)`, the inside 
of that loop would be repeated 12 times.

    >>>for i in range(4):
    ...    for j in range(3):
    ...        print i, j
    0 0
    0 1
    0 2
    1 0
    1 1
    1 2
    2 0
    2 1
    2 2
    3 0
    3 1
    3 2

Change some parts of the loop and run the code yourself. Make sure you 
understand the nested `for` loop before continuing with the lab, it will be 
useful throughout the assignment. 

## Write the `create_blank()` function

The first thing we need to do is create the board where we can store all the 
cells. What would be a good way to represent the alive and dead cells?

Here we will assume `0` to be a dead cell and `1` to be an alive cell, but 
almost any choice is fine, as long you are consistent. Now, what would be a 
good way to represent the entire board of cells?

The most logical choice would be a list of lists, also known as a 2-dimensional 
list. For a `5x5` board, this would look like:

    board = [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0]]

or formatted a little more nicely

    board = [[0,0,0,0,0],
             [0,0,0,0,0],
             [0,0,0,0,0],
             [0,0,0,0,0],
             [0,0,0,0,0]]

This way `row = board[i]` would give us the _i^th_ row of the board, which is
also a list. We could then access the _j^th_ cell, using `cell = row[j]`. We can 
also just use the 2 indices on the board directly, like `board[i][j]`.

Note that the first argument is the row of the board and the second the column. 
This means if we would want the `x,y` position on the board, we would ask for 
`board[y][x]`. Also, the `0^th` row is the top row of the board, so the position 
`0,0` is in the top left corner! 

### Creating the board

There are 2 constants at the top of the `game.py`, these are the `HEIGHT` and 
`WIDTH` of the game board (the other 2 constans are for the Pygame graphics and 
thus do not need to be used in your code). **Use the the `HEIGHT` and `WIDTH` to 
create a new list of lists of the appropriate size and return it**

With this function written, you should be able to run `python conway.py` and 
see the game board in Pygame!

## Write the `get_cell()` function

One of the main things we need to implement for the Game of Life is counting 
the number of alive neighbours of a cell. However, not every cell has 8 
neighbours, because of the edges of the board. So, in order to simplify counting 
the neighbours, we will first implement the `get_cell()` function. This should 
return the value of the cell at the position `x,y`, but only if `x` and `y` 
are valid board positions. How could you check this? What should you return if
the position is not valid?

Write the `get_cell()` function.

## Write the `count_neighbours()` function

Now we can write the `count_neighbours()` function. What would be a easy way to 
loop over all 8 neighbours?

**Hints** 

* Look at the nested `for` loop example at the start of the lab
* `range()` also has a 2 argument version, with a start: [link](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range)
* Remember to use the  `get_cell()` function you already wrote, so you don't have to worry about going outside the board.
* Make sure you skip the cell whose neighbours you are counting!

Finish writing the function and make sure you return the count at the end.
