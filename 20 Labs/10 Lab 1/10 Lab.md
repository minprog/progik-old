# Lab 1: Scratch

Questions? Join classmates at office hours or send an e-mail!

## Objectives

* Understand how information can be represented digitally.
* Leverage some fundamental programming constructs.
* Design your own animation, game, or interactive art.
* Impress your friends.

## Academic Honesty

As this is the first lab of the course, please refer to the collaboration and 'plagiaat' section at the bottom of the homepage.

## Assessment

Your work on this lab will be evaluated along two axes primarily.

Scope
: To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

Correctness
: To what extent is your code free of bugs?

All students must ordinarily submit this and all other labs and homeworks to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

## Itching to Program?

Next head to <http://scratch.mit.edu/> and sign up for an account on MIT's
website by clicking *Join Scratch* atop the page. Any username (that's
available) is fine, but take care to remember it and your choice of password.

Then head to <http://scratch.mit.edu/help/> and take note of the resources
available to you before you dive into Scratch itself. In particular, you might
want to skim the [Getting Started Guide][10].

Next head to <http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329354/> to see _Pikachu's Pastry Catch_ by Gabe Walker. Click the blue square above the game's top-left corner if you'd like to full-screen the user interface (UI). Then click the green flag. Per Gabe's instructions, as soon as you hit your keyboard's space bar, the game will begin! Feel free to procrastinate a bit. And if you'd like to try out _Ivy's Hardest Game_, by Carlos Pe√±a-Lobel, head to <http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329347/>.

If you've no experience (or comfort) whatsoever with programming, rest assured that Gabe's and Carlos's projects are more complex than what we expect for this first lab. (Click *See inside* in Scratch's top-right corner to look at each project's underlying "implementation details.") But they do reveal what you can do with Scratch. 

In fact, for a gentler introduction to Scratch (and programming more generally), you might want to review some of the examples that we looked at in Week 0's second lecture and take a look at a few more, the "source code" for which can be found at http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/522341/. Allow me to take you on a tour, though feel free to forge ahead on your own if you'd prefer:

And you might also want to watch Allison's short on Scratch:

Feel free to download the source code for a few more projects from <http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all/> or elsewhere.  For each program, run it to see how it works overall and then look over its scripts to understand how it works underneath the hood. Feel free to make changes to scripts and observe the effects. Once you can say to yourself, "Okay, I think I get this," you're ready to proceed.

Now it's time to choose your own adventure! Your mission is, quite simply, to have fun with Scratch and implement a project of your choice (be it an animation, a game, interactive art, or anything else), subject only to the following requirements.

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
* Your project must use at least one sound.
* Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than, say, _Pikachu's Pastry Catch_ and _Ivy's Hardest Game_. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Feel free to peruse additional projects online for inspiration, but your own project should not be terribly similar to any of them. Try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. But don't try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: pluck off one piece at a time. Gabe, for instance, probably implemented just one pastry first, before he moved onto the game's other sprites. And Carlos probably implemented Yale before he moved on to implementing MIT. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth.

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, you should not find it hard to satisfy this lab's requirements. 

Alright, off you go. Make us proud! 

Not quite sure how to begin? Feeling a bit overwhelmed? Not to worry. Join Zamyla for a walkthrough of this lab, if you'd like more of a tour:

Incidentally, if you don't have the best Internet access, you're welcome to download Scratch's "offline editor" at <http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/>. But when done with your project offline, be sure to upload it to your account at <http://scratch.mit.edu/> via *File > Share to website* in the offline editor.

Once finished with your project, click *See project page* in Scratch's top-right corner. Ensure your project has a title (in Scratch's top-left corner), some instructions (in Scratch's top-right corner), and some notes and/or credits (in Scratch's bottom-right corner). Then click *Share* in Scratch's top-right corner so that others (e.g., your TF!) can see your project. Finally, take note of the URL in your browser's address bar. That's your project's URL on MIT's website, and you'll need to know it later.

Oh, and if you'd like to exhibit your project in 2015's studio, head to <https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/1416378/>, then click *Add projects*, and paste in your own project's URL.
