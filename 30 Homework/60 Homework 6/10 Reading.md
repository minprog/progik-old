# Reading

This week's reading is two short articles about computer models of complex phenomena: one is on cities and the second one about markets:

## The articles

[Not-so-smart Cities](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/opinion/sunday/not-so-smart-cities.html) ( NYTimes, 9/25/11 ) [Here is a local pdf](not-so-smart-cities.pdf)

[Earthquakes on Wall Street (pdf)](earthquakes.pdf) ( InsideScience.org, 12/14/09 ) (this is a pdf of that article)


## The Questions (choose 1 to answer)

After reading the above articles, respond to ONE of the following questions (your choice) in a plain text file named `hw6pr0.txt`

* In light of the information in these articles, make an argument for whether and how computer models help—or hurt—society. A well-reasoned middle position is as welcome as a strong stand on either side.

* The earthquakes article raises the question, _How can we know if your computer program/model is 'right'?_ Based on the information in that article, how do you think computer scientists/scientists/mathematicians/engineers can ensure that their (our) models are correct? Can we at all?

* Identify another area of public discussion that relies on computational models... contrast the perceived reliability of those models with the ones described in the articles above. 

As with all of the readings, it is thoughtfulness more than amount of text that characterizes solid responses.
