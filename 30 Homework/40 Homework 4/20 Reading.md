# Homework 4: Reading

## The article

This week's article is about IBM's Watson, a software (and hardware) system that defeated two human champions at Jeopardy!

[Here is the 2/16/11 NYTimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html?_r=1&scp=12&sq=computer%20science&st=cse)

[Here is a pdf version in case you can not access the link above](watson.pdf)

Then, if you can access it, play for a few minutes with the ["Watson-representative" application at this link](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/06/16/magazine/watson-trivia-game.html?ref=science). 

## The questions

After you have read the above article and interacted with the Watson, write a paragraph that addresses—at least to some extent—all of the following questions either in a _plain text_ file called `hw4pr0.txt`.

* What was the most interesting or important idea in this article to you—and why?
* What is an application that (in your opinion) Watson's technology might be able to contribute to? Alternatively, do you feel Watson's capabilities will not make much of an impact? You can look around for web articles on this, or you're welcome to speculate.
* Whether or not you had the chance to interact with the "Watson-like" Jeopardy game, comment on your sense of the similarities and/or differences between Watson-style and human-style thinking. 

Once again, don't feel obligated to go beyond a few sentences in total. An ideal response would show that you'd thought critically about the material the author presents in the article and that you've brought your own ideas/background/experience into your response.
