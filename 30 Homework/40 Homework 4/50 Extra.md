# Extra: More Turtle?!??

If you'd like an extra challenge, you're invited to design and implement your own Python turtle-based artwork...

## Your custom recursive design

Here, create one or more recursive functions that uses turtle graphics to create a recursive artwork...

You may create your own functions, or add new parameters/capabilities to the above functions, or both.

Create a `hw4pr4.py` file in which to work

* Feel free to copy any of your lab functions into that file as a start
* In fact, one starting point might be _sprucing up_ your `svtree` function further by adding other cool features (or the snowflake) 

We're _pining_ for some interesting variants. If you do add extra features to your tree -- or create any other work -- make sure to add a comment within your `hw4pr4.py` file explaining how to run your code... .

Any composition is welcome. There needs to be _some_ recursive function of your own design that contributes to your art, but it does **not** have to be entirely recursive... !

## Other turtle capabilities

Feel free to explore [Python's turtle library reference](http://docs.python.org/library/turtle.html) for ideas on turtle's capabilities.

The `fill` and `color` settings, in particular, are fun to try... .

**Have fun with turtle!**
