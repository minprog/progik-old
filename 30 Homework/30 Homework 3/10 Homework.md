# Homework 2: Python

## A Note About Extra Credit Problems

The extra credit problems are, of course, totally optional. We provide them for two reasons. First, it's a chance to earn a few more points on each homework. Second -- and much more importantly -- these problems are fun and useful! for example, this week's second extra credit has you experimenting with reading files in Python.

We strive to keep the required workload in this class to a challenging but reasonable level -- we know you have many other classes, not to mention lives. But we also want to give those of you who want (or need!) a little more CS in your lives a chance to work on some additional challenges.

## Submission

For each of these problems, you should be sure to name your file as indicated above. Then, you should submit the files at the very end of this page!

## Credit for Lab Work

If you submitted hw1pr1.py and hw1pr2.py during the lab period, you will receive full credit for those two problems (even if you didn't finish). In this case, you will only need to submit the other problems. If you did not participate in lab, you should finish those two, as well.

## Working in Pairs

For this assignment, you may work on all of the Python with up to one other student. The reading you should complete on your own. Pair programming is completely optional - you may do all of the problems on your own, if you wish. For this first assignment there is no individual programming problem, but in future weeks there will be at least one. If you choose to work with a partner on all of the programming problems, please make sure that both partners completely understand what is going on.

Here are the individual- and pair-work guidelines:

- If you work individually, the work you submit should be your own. You are encouraged to seek help from CS 5's instructors and student graders/tutors. You may also discuss problems with fellow students, but those discussions must not involve one person doing the work for another. This link on the CS 5 assignment work policy goes into more detail.

- If you work as a pair, the above guidelines hold for the pair. In particular, the pair should work in the same physical location on the same "physical" file contribute equally to the work submit work that is their own, just as noted above for individuals you don't need to work on all of the pair problems in a pair. If in doubt don't hesitate to get in touch with any of the CS 5 instructors.
