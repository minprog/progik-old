# Homework 3: Recursion

## A Note About Extra Credit Problems

The extra credit problems are, of course, totally optional. We provide them for two reasons. First, it's a chance to earn a few more points on each homework. Second -- and much more importantly -- these problems are fun and useful! for example, this week's second extra credit has you experimenting with reading files in Python.

We strive to keep the required workload in this class to a challenging but reasonable level -- we know you have many other classes, not to mention lives. But we also want to give those of you who want (or need!) a little more CS in your lives a chance to work on some additional challenges.

## Submission

For each of these problems, you should be sure to name your file as indicated above. Then, you should submit the files at the very end of this page!
