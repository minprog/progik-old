## The article

This week's article, "The end of theory," comes from *Wired* and dovetails with its theme of data and its possibilities.

- Here is a link to the [article in Wired](http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory)
- Here is a locally stored pdf, if you'd prefer: [end_of_theory.pdf](end_of_theory.pdf)

## The questions

After you have read the above article, write a response that addresses one or the other of the following questions.

As with reading 0, please be sure you name your file hw3pr0.txt - it should be a plain-text .txt file. As a reminder, this link details how to [create plain-text files on any OS](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5Spring2015/CreatingPlainTextFilesInAnyOS).

Choose one of these prompts and construct a paragraph (4-6 sentences is fine) that responds to it. Use/extend (or alter/refute) ideas from the article!

Anderson refers to one's "MySpace" page. This is a clear, if superficial, way in which this article (at less than 7 years old) shows its age. What is a deeper way in which the ideas of this article betray thinking that has moved on since 2008? Contrast one of its ideas with more recent thinking, which can be your own, others', or both. 

The article states that, whether in science or business, we "don't have to settle for models at all." Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more nuanced or hybrid view, if you'd like.
