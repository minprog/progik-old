This week there won't be any articles to read. You should just write a short 
response to the following.

The Game of Life is a good example of complex properties resulting from simple 
rules. This is called _emergent behaviour_.

* Do you think it is likely that that actual life (e.g. animals and plants) is 
also emergent from a few simple rules?
  * If so, what do you think those rules look like?
  * If not, why not?

Save you response as `hw7pr0.txt` .
