## Working individually vs. working in pairs

All homework assignments will have a mix of individual and pair-programming problems. For this assignment, you may work on all of the problems with one other student. This is completely optional—you may, of course, do all of the problems on your own if you wish.

## Guidelines:

- If you work individually, the work you submit should be your own. You are
  encouraged to seek help from CS 5's instructors and student graders/tutors.
  You may also discuss problems with fellow students, but those discussions
  must not involve one person doing the work for another. This link on the CS 5
  assignment work policy goes into more detail.

- If you work in a group, the above guidelines hold for the pair. Also, the
  pair should make sure they work in the same physical location on the same
  machine—if you're not working together, you're not working as a pair they
  contribute equally to the work they submit work that is their own, just as
  noted above for individuals If you have concerns or questions about this
  policy, feel free to email your instructor or stop by and chat.
