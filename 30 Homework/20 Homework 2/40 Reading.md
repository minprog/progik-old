# Reading

[5 points]

Introduction to the readings!

Reading
: Typically, problem 0 on each week's homework will be a short reading/response assignment. (Only this week is it problem 6...) The readings are short excerpts from recent-ish news; they are relevant and interesting â€”at least to us! The readings may not relate directly to the technical topics that you will be learning in class; rather, their goal is to give you a chance to explore the many real-world facets of CS.

Response
: We ask you to compose a response to each article. It should be short, but we hope you will engage with something in each article and put some thought into your response. These responses are worth about 5 points each week. You'll need to submit your response in a .txt plain-text file. For this reading, it needs to be named **hw2pr6.txt**. This way, you will have a copy of it on your own machine, as well.

Warning!
: As noted in problem 0, the submission site will not let you submit a Microsoft Word file, an RTF (rich text format) file, or any other file except a plain-text .txt file. As we noted above, it's a great skill to be able to create plain-text .txt files. Here is a page with detailed instructions:

## Article

This week's article is about two fundamental facets of CS: language and thought.

It also relates the wonderful story of the Picobot-like human language Guugu Yimithirr!

Here is the excerpt: [Reading (pdf)](language_shapes.pdf)

If the ideas pique your interest, you might read the full NYTimes article on whether and how language can shape human thought; it includes many other (non-geographic) examples, as well... .

## Questions

After you have read the above excerpt (or whole article), create a response to the article that addresses one or both of the following prompts in a plain-text file named hw0pr6.txt, which you should submit through the submissions system.

1. Have there been moments in which you felt that your language or another language "got in the way" of something you wanted to accomplish? That is, have you "bumped into a language's boundaries," in the manner suggested by the article? Elaborate briefly. or

2. To what extent do artificial languages (such as Python or Picobot) have the ability to shape human thought, if at all? Or are such languages fundamentally different from human ones, such as Guugu Yimithirr or English?

You only need write a few sentences: a paragraph of 4-6 sentences certainly suffices. More is welcome, but the real goal is that your response shows you have thought about the article and added your own experience or insights to its ideas.
