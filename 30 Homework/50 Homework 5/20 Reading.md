# Reading

[5 points] `hw5pr0.txt`

This week's CS assignments will exercise the skill of algorithm development and deployment.

This week's reading asks the unusual question of whether we might _already be deployed_, so to speak, i.e., whether our universe is _real_ in the common-sense sense or whether it might itself be a simulation.

The article is by UC Berkeley mathematician, [Edward Frenkel](http://math.berkeley.edu/~frenkel/) - you may know of some of his other interesting work ... .


## The article

* [Is the Universe a Simulation](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/opinion/sunday/is-the-universe-a-simulation.html?_r=0) by Edward Frenkel
* In case this link does not work, [here is a locally-stored copy of this article](is_all_this_for_real.pdf) 

##The prompts:

Please write a paragraph (maybe 5+ sentences) that responds to the article and includes thoughts on both of the following prompts:

1. **Are we** actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybe...? Why do you think so (or not)?
2. If we were, in fact, in a simulation, would that change _your view of our world_? How (or not)? 

As with all of the reading responses, a paragraph of a few carefully considered sentences that draw from the article is great! (You're welcome to elaborate, but don't feel it's necessary... .)
