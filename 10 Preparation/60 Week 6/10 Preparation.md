# Welcome to week 4!

This week, we are going for a loop!

## CS for All, Imperative Programming

The sections this week are all about loops, using `for` and `while`. The Think 
Python link is a short introduction to dictionaries, which we will be using in 
this weeks assignment.

* Feel free to skip 5.3.1, as we did not cover chapter 4
