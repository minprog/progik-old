# Week 2 Preparations

This week, we'll learn to program the Picobot and start writing our own programs in Python!

## CS for All, Picobot and functions


The first section covers the Picobot simulation and how we can write rules to program the bot:

The second section covers functions and conditionals (if-statements) in Python.

If we have a problem at hand that we would like to solve using a program, we might decompose this problem into smaller pieces. Particularly, we would probably decompose until we find problem piece that we know how to solve using small *functions*. In this chapter, you'll read about functions and their application in programming.

Read the chapter any way you want, but do not forget to try out many of the examples! It is wise to type them into a Python editor, and not copy-paste. In this way, you'll probably make some mistakes, *and mistakes will help you learn a lot more!*

So, make mistakes!

## Installing Python

Here is [the link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/) to the installers for Python version 2.7.10.

DO NOT install Python 3.x! This version of Python works differently. 2.7.10 is just as new but works the way we intend it to work!
