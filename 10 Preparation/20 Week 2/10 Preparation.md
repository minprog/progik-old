# Week 2 Preparations

This week, we'll combine our knowledge of algorithms and the Python practice to dive into problem solving.

## CS for All, Functional programming

If we have a problem at hand that we would like to solve using a program, we might decompose this problem into smaller pieces. Particularly, we would probably decompose until we find problem piece that we know how to solve using small *functions*. In this chapter, you'll read about functions and their application in programming.

Read the chapter any way you want, but do not forget to try out many of the examples! It is wise to type them into a Python editor, and not copy-paste. In this way, you'll probably make some mistakes, *and mistakes will help you learn a lot more!*

So, make mistakes!
