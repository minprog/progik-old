# Welcome to week 7!

This week, we will finish the chapter on imperative programming

## CS for All, Imperative Programming

The sections this week cover some sorting algorithms, 2D lists, dictionaries, 
reading from files and program design.

[Chapter 5.5-5.8](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/ImperativeProgramming/imperativeprogramming.html#mutable-data-iteration-sorting-out-artists)

### Pygame

For the lab and homework this week we will use Pygame to visualize the results. 

[Download Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) (You will want the 
py2.7 version)

**Make sure to install this before the Lab** To check if it works correctly, 
simply open the Python shell and try to import it

    >>> import pygame

If this doesn't produce errors, then everything works!
